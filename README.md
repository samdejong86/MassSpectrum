# MassSpectrum

The two files here contain classes which implement a mass spectrum analysis. They are written in C++, and use the ROOT analysis framework developed by CERN for matrix manipulation. These classes were used to fit the output of a residual gas analyzer to a collection of molecules, to determine the relative abundance of each.
